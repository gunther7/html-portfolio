<h1>The Best Movies According to Richard</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Young Frankenstein</h3>
<p>This is my favorite movie of all. Classic actors and funny as hell lines.</p>
<h3>Jaws</h3>
<p>I saw this for the first time in a drive-in theatre in Indiana and it was amazing on a huge screen.</p>
<h3>The Hateful Eight</h3>
<p>Quentin Tarantino's take on a western is visually spectacular, the score is out of this world and the story line is unforgettable.</p>
